This currently implements Modular Monolith: all services are in 1 solution and compose all services at the same time. 

Based on my current understanding tt can be structured like this so that each service have it's own solution and repo.


RootFolder/
├── Solution1/
│   ├── ProjectA/
│   ├── ProjectB/
│   └── docker-compose.yml  # For services in Solution1
├── Solution2/
│   ├── ProjectC/
│   ├── ProjectD/
│   └── docker-compose.yml  # For services in Solution2
├── Solution3/
│   └── ProjectE/
│       └── docker-compose.yml  # For service in Solution3
└── master-docker-compose.yml  # Includes and extends all others
